# Python Basics Project

## Description
This project is an introduction to Python programming. It covers the fundamental concepts of control flow, loops, functions, and variables. The goal is to help beginners understand the core principles of Python and write basic, clean, and efficient code.

---

## Learning Objectives
By completing this project, you will be able to:

- Understand why indentation is crucial in Python.
- Use `if` and `if...else` statements to handle conditions.
- Write and understand comments in Python code.
- Assign values to variables and use them effectively.
- Use `while` and `for` loops for iteration.
- Apply `break` and `continue` statements to control loop execution.
- Implement `else` clauses in loops for additional control flow.
- Understand and use the `pass` statement.
- Use the `range` function to generate sequences of numbers.
- Define and use functions to encapsulate reusable code blocks.
- Understand the return value of functions, including those without explicit `return` statements.
- Differentiate between local and global variable scopes.
- Interpret Python traceback messages.
- Use arithmetic operators in Python.

## Requirements

### General
- All Python scripts will be interpreted/compiled using Python 3.8.* on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS.
- All files must end with a new line.
- The first line of all files must be exactly:

  ```bash
  #!/usr/bin/python3
  ```

- A `README.md` file at the root of the project folder is mandatory.
- Code must comply with PEP 8 style (verified using `pycodestyle` version 2.7.*).
- All files must be executable.

### Tools
- Text editors allowed: `vi`, `vim`, or `emacs`.
- Use the command `wc` to verify file lengths.

## File Structure
Each Python script in the project addresses specific tasks or exercises to practice the concepts listed in the Learning Objectives.

## Resources
To complete the project, you can use the following resources:

- [More Control Flow Tools](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/controlflow.html) (read until “4.6. Defining Functions” included).
- [IndentationError](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#indentation).
- [How To Use String Formatters in Python 3](https://realpython.com/python-string-formatting/).
- [Learn to Program 2 : Looping](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL1B24DF1B61636B24).
- [Pycodestyle – Style Guide for Python Code](https://pycodestyle.readthedocs.io/).

For commands or detailed usage, use `man python3` or `help()` in the Python interpreter.

## How to Run
1. Make the script executable:
   ```bash
   chmod +x <script_name>.py
   ```
2. Run the script using:
   ```bash
   ./<script_name>.py
   ```
