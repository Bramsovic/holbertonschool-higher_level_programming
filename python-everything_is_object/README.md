# Python - Everything is Object

## 📚 Description

This project dives deep into Python’s object model, focusing on how variables reference objects in memory. Understanding the difference between identity, mutability, assignment, and references is crucial to mastering Python and avoiding unexpected behavior.

You’ll analyze and reason through code snippets that test your knowledge of how Python handles variables and objects—no coding until you’ve thought through the logic!

---

## 🧠 Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to explain:

- What is an object in Python
- The difference between a class, an object, and an instance
- The concept of mutability and immutability
- What references, aliases, and assignments are
- How to check if two variables point to the same object (`is`) vs. having equal content (`==`)
- How to retrieve an object’s memory address with `id()`
- Python’s built-in mutable and immutable types
- How Python passes variables to functions

---

## 🛠️ Requirements

### Python Scripts
- All scripts run with Python 3.8.5 on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
- Use `#!/usr/bin/python3` as the first line of every script
- Respect `pycodestyle` (version 2.7.*)
- Each file must end with a newline
- Must be executable

### Answer Files (.txt)
- Only **one** line (your answer)
- No shebang
- Ends with a newline

## 📁 Project Structure

Each task requires you to provide either:
- A one-line text answer in `*.txt` files
- A short, functional Python script
- A written blog post (last task)

## 🧪 Tasks Overview

| Task | Description |
|------|-------------|
| 0-1  | Identify object type and memory address |
| 2-5  | Determine if two variables point to the same object |
| 6-13 | Test equality (`==`) vs identity (`is`) with strings and lists |
| 14-15 | Effects of `append` vs `+` on lists |
| 16-18 | Behavior of function parameters with mutable and immutable types |
| 19 | Function that copies a list (3 lines max) |
| 20-23 | Tuple identification |
| 24-26 | Tuple identity comparisons |
| 27-28 | `id()` after mutation or reassignment |
| 29 | Write and publish a blog post summarizing the project |

---

## 📝 Blog Post

Task #29 requires writing a detailed post on everything learned. Topics include:

- `id()` and `type()`
- Mutable vs Immutable objects
- How Python passes function arguments
- Real-world implications and code examples

**Publish it on Medium or LinkedIn** and share the URL in your project submission.

## 🧠 Pro Tip

> **Don’t code before you think.** You’re not just solving puzzles—you’re building a deep understanding of how Python *really* works.
