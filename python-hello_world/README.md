# Python - Hello, World

## Description
This repository contains solutions to the **Python - Hello, World** project. The project introduces fundamental Python programming concepts, including using the Python interpreter, printing text and variables, working with strings, and adhering to Python's official coding style (`pycodestyle`).

---

## Learning Objectives
At the end of this project, you should be able to explain the following without external assistance:

- How to use the Python interpreter.
- How to print text and variables using `print`.
- How to work with strings, including slicing and indexing.
- The official Python coding style and how to check your code with `pycodestyle`.

---

## Requirements

### Python Scripts
- Files must be interpreted/compiled on **Ubuntu 20.04 LTS** using Python 3.8.
- The first line of every file must be `#!/usr/bin/python3`.
- All files must end with a new line.
- Files must conform to `pycodestyle` (version 2.7).
- Files must be executable.
- Script lengths will be checked using `wc`.

## Tasks

### 0. Hello, print
Write a script that prints:

```
"Programming is like building a multilingual puzzle
```

**File:** `2-print.py`

---

### 1. Print integer
Complete the source code to print the integer stored in the variable `number`, followed by `Battery street`.

- Use `f-strings`.

**File:** `3-print_number.py`

---

### 2. Print float
Complete the source code to print the float stored in the variable `number` with a precision of 2 digits.

- Use `f-strings`.

**File:** `4-print_float.py`

---

### 3. Print string
Complete the source code to:
- Print the string stored in `str` three times.
- Print the first 9 characters of `str`.

**File:** `5-print_string.py`

---

### 4. Play with strings
Concatenate `str1` and `str2` to print:

```
Welcome to Holberton School!
```

**File:** `6-concat.py`

---

### 5. Copy - Cut - Paste
Extract parts of the string `word` to:
- Print the first 3 letters (`word_first_3`).
- Print the last 2 letters (`word_last_2`).
- Print the middle of the word (`middle_word`).

**File:** `7-edges.py`

---

### 6. Create a new sentence
Concatenate parts of a string to print:

```
object-oriented programming with Python
```

**File:** `8-concat_edges.py`

---

### 7. Easter Egg
