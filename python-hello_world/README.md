# Python - Hello, World

## 📖 Description
This repository contains solutions to the **Python - Hello, World** project. The project introduces fundamental Python programming concepts, including:

- Using the Python interpreter.
- Printing text and variables.
- Working with strings (slicing, indexing, and concatenation).
- Adhering to Python's official coding style (`pycodestyle`).

This is a beginner-friendly project designed to build a strong foundation in Python programming.

---

## 🎯 Learning Objectives
By the end of this project, you should be able to explain the following concepts **without external assistance**:

- How to use the Python interpreter.
- How to print text and variables using the `print()` function.
- How to work with strings, including slicing and indexing.
- The official Python coding style and how to check your code with `pycodestyle`.

---

## ✅ Requirements

### Python Scripts
- All files must be interpreted/compiled on **Ubuntu 20.04 LTS** using **Python 3.8**.
- The first line of every file must be:
  ```bash
  #!/usr/bin/python3
  ```
- All files must:
  - End with a **new line**.
  - Be **executable**.
  - Follow the **PEP 8** coding style, verified using `pycodestyle` (version 2.7.*).
- Script lengths will be verified using the `wc` command.
