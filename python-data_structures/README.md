# Python - Data Structures: Lists, Tuples

## 📖 Description
This project is part of the **Holberton School Higher-Level Programming** curriculum. It focuses on **data structures** in Python, specifically **lists** and **tuples**. Through these tasks, you'll explore how to manipulate lists, utilize tuple packing and unpacking, and understand when to use each data structure effectively.

The project is designed to deepen your understanding of Python's powerful data structures and their applications in problem-solving.

## 🎯 Learning Objectives
By the end of this project, you should be able to explain the following concepts **without external help**:

### General
- What are **lists** and how to use them.
- Differences and similarities between **strings** and **lists**.
- Common **list methods** and how to use them.
- How to use lists as **stacks** and **queues**.
- What are **list comprehensions** and how to use them.
- What are **tuples** and how to use them.
- When to use **tuples** versus **lists**.
- What is a **sequence** in Python.
- What is **tuple packing** and **sequence unpacking**.
- How to use the **`del`** statement.

---

## ✅ Requirements

### Python Scripts
- All scripts are interpreted/compiled using **Python 3.8.5** on **Ubuntu 20.04 LTS**.
- The first line of all scripts must be:
  ```bash
  #!/usr/bin/python3
  ```
- All files must:
  - End with a **new line**.
  - Be **PEP 8 compliant** (validated with `pycodestyle` version 2.7.*).
  - Be **executable**.
  - Be tested for length using the `wc` command.

### Allowed Editors
- `vi`, `vim`, or `emacs`.
