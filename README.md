# holbertonschool-higher_level_programming

## Description

This repository contains projects completed as part of the Holberton School curriculum, focusing on high-level programming. These projects cover a variety of concepts and languages such as Python, SQL, Flask, and more. The main goal is to learn and master essential tools, languages, and practices for high-level software development.

## Content

The repository is structured into several directories, each corresponding to a specific project or topic:

- **[python-hello_world](./python-hello_world)**: Introduction to Python, scripts, indentation, and basic concepts.
- **[python-if_else_loops_functions](./-python-if_else_loops_functions)**: Conditions, loops, and functions in Python.
- **[python-import_modules](./python-import_modules)**: Using modules and imports in Python.
- **[python-data_structures](./python-data_structures)**: Data structures like lists and tuples.
- **[python-more_data_structures](./0python-more_data_structures)**: Advanced concepts with dictionaries and sets.
